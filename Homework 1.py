#Task 1: Code Correction

# weather = "sunny"

# if weather == "sunny":
#     print("Wear sunglasses!")
# else:
#     print("Take an umbrella!")

#Task 2: Your Mood Today

# print("How do you feel today?")

#  if "happy":
#     print("That's great to hear!")
# else:
#     print("I hope your day gets better!")



# Ask the user how they feel today
# user_feeling = input("How do you feel today? (happy or sad): ")

# # Check the user's response and print the appropriate message
# if user_feeling == "happy":
#     print("That's great to hear!")
# elif user_feeling == "sad":
#     print("I hope your day gets better!")

# 2. Python Naming Convention Practice


# Task 1: Code Correction


# pi_value = 3.14
# user_age = 25
# user_location = "New York"
# max_limit = 1000

# 3. Python Data Types and type() Function

# Task 1: Code Correction

# variable_a = "Hello, World!"
# variable_b = 23
# variable_c = 3.14
# variable_d = True

# print(type(variable_a))
# print(type(variable_b))
# print(type(variable_c))
# print(type(variable_d))

# 4. Arithmetic Operations in Daily Life

# Task 2: Bank Interest

# fruits = {"apple": 1.79,"banana": 0.39,"orange": 0.79}
# total_cost = sum(fruits.value())
# print(total_cost)


# 5. Understanding Assignments and Comparisons

# Task 1: Value Swapping

# initial_rate = 10700
# interest_rate = 7

# total_amount = initial_rate * (1 + interest_rate / 100)

#print("after one year. the total is:", total_amount)


# 6. Exploring Logical Operations and Precedence

# Task 1: Validating Calculations
# normal_calculation = 3 + 4 * 2
# with_parentheses = (3 + 4) * 2

# Task 2: Mix and Match
# mix_match_expression = 3 + 4 > 5 or 2 + 2 == 4

# Output results
# print("Task 1 - Normal Calculation:", normal_calculation)
# print("Task 1 - With Parentheses:", with_parentheses)
# print("Task 2 - Mix and Match Result:", mix_match_expression)
